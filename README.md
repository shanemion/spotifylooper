# Spotify Looper

Spotify Looper is a Python project that leverages the Spotify API to create a customizable looping feature for your favorite tracks. The loop's start and end times can be defined manually in the format MM:SS. This application uses the tkinter library to provide a simple and straightforward user interface.

## Features

1. **Time Customization:** Define your loop's start and end times to suit your needs.
2. **Toggle Looping:** Start and stop the loop feature at your convenience with a simple click.
3. **Threaded Operation:** The looping operation runs in a separate thread to prevent excessive resource usage.

## Usage

1. Input the start and end times for your desired loop in the format MM:SS.
2. Click on 'Loop Song' button to start looping the current song between these specified times.
3. Click on 'Stop Song' button to stop the loop.

Please note that your Spotify Developer credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI) are required to use this application.

Spotify Looper is a perfect tool for musicians, dancers, choreographers, and anyone who needs to repeatedly practice a specific section of a song. Whether you're rehearsing for a performance or simply enjoy hearing your favorite chorus on repeat, Spotify Looper is here to enhance your musical experience!!!!
